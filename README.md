# Monty_Hall
This is a python script that simulates the classic Monty Hall problem with 3 doors.
I really did not believe that switching would change the players luck of winning the car
but as this simulation would show you that in fact it is the case that switching can 
drastically increasing your chances of winning that prized car. run this for your self and 
see how switcher beats the stayer twice as often. Plus if you change the num_sim variable (line 50) to
a larger value you will see the switcher ratio approach 0.666 which is 2/3 (3 d.p) in decimal
